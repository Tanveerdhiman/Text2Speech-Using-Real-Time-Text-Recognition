# Text2Speech-Using-Real-Time-Text-Recognition

Text2Speech using Real Time Text Recognition – This app perform Real time Text Recognition operation on live video feed coming from device’s camera and as we tap on a specific line in the paragraph it starts reading entire paragraph from that specific line till the end of the page and draws a box over the Line / Word its reading.

It utilizes device’s build in Text To Speech Engine to speak the text detected on the page back to us.

Problem Statement - Often times whenever we are reading a book, we often struggle to concentrate on the topic especially if it’s something really boring and non-stimulating in nature and we find ourselves flipping through pages after pages only to come back to page 1 as we realize we haven’t assimilated the topic enough and we get stuck in this vicious cycle of re-reading topics again and again until we finally get really frustrated and leave the task all together.

In that situation we often want someone to explain or readout the topic loud to us so that we can shut off all the mental noise and focus on the topic in hand,
That’s why its often said that if you can’t focus on reading, Try reading out loud as it stimulates you mind and suppress all the mental noise going on in your head.
Reading is especially a problem for people suffering from Dyslexia which is a learning disorder that involves difficulty reading due to problems identifying speech sounds and learning how they relate to letters and words.

Solution – To overcome this problem I designed this app which reads out text loud to you and help you understand the topic better, My main vision with this app is to integrate it with Augmented Reality Smart glasses(or reading glasses in simpler terms) which one will wear while reading,

The app will be integrated into the glasses and use the camera in the smart glasses to recognize the text written on the book and as the user taps on a line it start speaking that line back to user, which will help one concentrate better.
One can also double tap on a specific word to find out its meaning and display relevant images or info or even 3d models in specific cases.

Read out aloud feature has been integrated in various reading apps for example - Microsoft’s Edge have Immersive or Reading Mode where the browser reads the book for you and you just listen to the book as its reading, Which helps shuts off the mental noise and concentrate better.
Am trying to implement this on a larger scale where in future instead of using Mobile phones we will wear these Special glasses on our face and this app in particular will help us read and understand things better, Along with other features.
